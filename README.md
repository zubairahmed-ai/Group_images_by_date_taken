### Here's the ChatGPT prompt that was used to generate this code

`you are a talented python and opencv engineer, write a python code that loops through all images in a folder, checks their metadata and if images are taken within 1 day of each other it groups them by folder, name the folder in the format Year_month_day.  update the code to reflect that all images taken on the same day are grouped in one folder. use the copy2 function from shutil to copy image files. optimize the code so that is faster to execute and more memory efficient. do more to read and copy files so that it's faster to execute, also include a progress monitor in the code`
